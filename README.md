NC-News is a forum/news website similar to reddit where users can view articles and comment on them. It is built using grid and flexbox so is responsive to mobile screens.

I made this website in 2 weeks while on NorthCoders. The backend is written using full TDD and hosted on heroku. The frontend is built using react and hosted with netlify.
